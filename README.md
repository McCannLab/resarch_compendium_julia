![Reproduce the analysis](https://github.com/McCannLab/resarch_compendium_julia/workflows/Reproduce%20the%20analysis/badge.svg)

This is a template repository, i.e. a repository that can be used to populate a repository when starting a new project from scratch. 

This repository includes: 
  1. a minimal example in `script.jl`
  2. A working workflow to test the code on [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

:warning: Avoid long run when you project is private as we have a limited number of seconds per month for private repository.
